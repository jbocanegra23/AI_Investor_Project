# Code from final projects during the JPMC Machine Learning Essentials course that I took during Fall of 2021. 

Really enjoyed these two projects. Really fun use of machine learning for practicing the techniques learned during the course.

## Project 1: AI_Investor_Project
The goal of this project is to build a price momentum model that uses data about the price of a stock in the previous days to predict the price of the stock in the next day. One comment is that during my time working in a Boutique Investment Firm, typically the target variable is the return of the stock in the following 1 month or 3 months, and then find the rank correlation between the predicted returns and the actual returns.

Nonetheless, this was fun to create something that is automated and can function on the fly. There are two files: final and analysis. Analysis shows the feature selection, feature engineering, model building, hyper-parameter tuning and model validation process. Final file tries to "productionize" the code.

## Project 2: Bank Term Project (in progress)
